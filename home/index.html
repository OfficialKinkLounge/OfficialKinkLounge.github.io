<br>
Today, on the 20th of October 2014, Medium J received 3 strikes for spamming, changing the edition name to nothing and impersonating a fellow Kinker on the official group chat. Jack (aka Lilâ€™ J) made a strawpoll with 4 options the first one being a public beating, which was the first of its kind. If you do not know what a public beating is, it is when everyone in the kink lounge has to slap you once in the calf. After everyone had voted the punishment of a public beating won, by two after being muted for two weeks, the event started a 2pm AEST. Jackson Had to bend over with his hands on the mighty telephone gods, our glorious leaders started it off by slapping both legs at the same time after that, most of the other Kink Loungers went on to slap him in order of when they joined.

On the way to health in P2 today, Medium C, Medium J and Big C found a Watering Hole. Medium J wanted to use it as he was thirsty. But to his diipontment it was empty and dried up. It was not long until they discovered it was an African Watering Hole! Nobody will ever attempt to use it again.

The tap built into the wall at the primary watering hole has been broken, due to Brodie turning the tap rapidly. The tap is now always on and water is now always coming out. But the water system for that tap has been shut down. So now the tap big Brodie broke is now always on but no water is coming out. It makes all the boys moist.

Three weeks ago in Drama, Ronan came across a very large spider. The spider didn't seem to be poisonous, so Ronan sat on a chair and humped the spider for approximately four seconds. Ronan was enjoying himself while raping the spider, but sadly, it only lasted a short amount of time. Now that three weeks has passed, Ronan is still getting 10 meter long erections because of the spider and continues to have wet dreams.

<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; color:#000; font-size:32px; font-weight:bold; margin-left:10px; margin-top:-10px;">savman98 attacks the Skanklord</p>

<strong>Submitted by Caleb</strong>
<br>
During the lunch break of the 8th October, 2014, a student by the name of Paul, known online as "savman98" was rolling past the Stomping Grounds. He was listening in on Kinker's conversations, and overheard us talking about his sweet YouTube channel, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/savman98">savman98</a>. He assumed we were making fun of him, and he set foot on the grounds. The Telephone Gods could not stop him, as his mass causes a velocity to large for the Telephone Gods to with hold. As he approached Aydan, he attempted to trip Aydan, and then fell in a big heap. Everybody in the immediate vicinity laughed at him, and he became embarrassed. It was not long before some other "danks" were at his side, and they asked him if he was OK. Paul fled the scene.
<br>
<br>
Below, you can view a video highlighting the incident.

<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; color:#000; font-size:32px; font-weight:bold; margin-left:10px; margin-top:-10px;">Medium J splits pants</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size:20px; color:#000; width:50%;">
<strong>Submitted by Caleb</strong>
<br>
 During an intense game of 'Dead Fish' played out during class on the last day of term, Jackson found a way to split his pants.
 <br>
 <br>
 When Medium J was caught moving, he was asked to stand up, as he did so, a loud tearing noise filled the room. "What was that?" people asked.
 It wasn't long before people knew. Jackson had torn a 20cm or so long hole in the inside seem of his left leg. Medium J proceeded to cover it with
 his jumper, by tying it around his waist, as he rejected the teachers offer to wear spare pants from the Well-being Centre.
 <br>
 <br>
 Here is what some other Kinkers had to say about the event:
 <br>
 <br>
 <i>"To be honest, it moistened my tip when I saw Medium J's boxers."</i> -Jack
 <br>
 <br>
 <i>"Is it weird that I had a wet dream about this?"</i> -Curt
 <br>
 <br>
 <i>"You might as well just take off those pants now, Medium J."</i> -Caleb
 <br>
 <br>
 <i>"Yes, that did make me erect."</i> -Joe

Recently, some kinkers have found that there are, "Danks" slowly invading the stomping ground. They have come across said slow invasion whilst completing domestic tasks. It began a small amount of time ago when kinkers noticed Danks on the border of the stomping ground, this was on day one, by day two they had fully engulfed the lower half of the stomping ground, by day three they had seemingly left, although rumours are circulating that they are planting spy's, Matt Burfitt; people are suspecting that he is a Spy, although rumours are not confirmed. Is there an invasion on the way? Tell us what you think below.

    Nath farted today during SOSE in the auditorium. The fart caused Lil C and Lil J to depart Nath's presence, as they were disturbed by the sudden explosion of gas from Nath's anus. The fart had a sound lasting approximately 3 seconds and was sort of loud. The stench did not appear as it was a stenchless fart. But that didn't stop Lil C and Lil J from moving. So the aftermath of the anal explosion was Nath (almost) dying from laughter alone.

Just after the vote and ban of Nath, it was discovered that Cameron had voted multiple times, with the use of his mobile phone, as it has a different IP address. The decision was made to set Cameron to a listener for 2 weeks.
<br>
Nath was reverted to the correct fate, and is now a listener for 2 weeks, as we felt that one month was to harsh. K-mart and Coles customer support has been notified.

Only three days after joining, Nath received his third strike for misbehaviour, going against the guidelines. His three strikes were as follows:
<br>
<br>
<strong>Strike 1: </strong>Spamming the chat, even after being asked to stop.
<br>
<strong>Strike 2: </strong>Rapidly updating image and topic, removing official topic.
<br>
<strong>Strike 3: </strong>Disrespecting fellow Kink Lounger, via shutting down of a PC. It resulted in the loss of 20 hours of work.
<br>
<br>
The decision was made to ban him forever, via a democratic strawpoll.
