<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; color:#000; font-size:32px; font-weight:bold; margin-left:10px; margin-top:-10px;">Big C accused of treason.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size:20px; color:#000; width:50%;">Just after the vote and ban of Nath, it was discovered that Cameron had voted multiple times, with the use of his mobile phone, as it has a different IP address. The decision was made to set Cameron to a listener for 2 weeks.
<br>
Nath was reverted to the correct fate, and is now a listener for 2 weeks, as we felt that one month was to harsh. K-mart and Coles customer support has been notified.

<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; color:#000; font-size:32px; font-weight:bold; margin-left:10px; margin-top:-10px;">Nath banned from Kink Lounge!</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size:20px; color:#000; width:50%;">Only three days after joining, Nath received his third strike for misbehaviour, going against the guidelines. His three strikes were as follows:
<br>
<br>
<strong>Strike 1: </strong>Spamming the chat, even after being asked to stop.
<br>
<strong>Strike 2: </strong>Rapidly updating image and topic, removing official topic.
<br>
<strong>Strike 3: </strong>Disrespecting fellow Kink Lounger, via shutting down of a PC. It resulted in the loss of 20 hours of work.
<br>
<br>
The decision was made to ban him forever, via a democratic strawpoll.
